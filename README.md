## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to develop a scalable E-Learning platform. Teachers will create course content using
markdown, while students can access the material, take quizzes, and submit assignments. AI detection tools will assist
teachers in identifying AI-generated content in assignments. The system uses a React.js frontend to provide a seamless
user experience.

## 1.2 Project Overview

**Capabilities:**

- Teachers can create and manage courses, quizzes, and assignments.
- Students can browse courses, take quizzes, and submit assignments.
- AI detection evaluates assignments for AI-generated content.
- Notifications are sent to students and teachers about grades and submissions.

**Scenarios for Using the Product:**

- A teacher creates a course and assigns a quiz or assignment. Students complete the quiz or assignment, and the system
  calculates their scores.
- A teacher checks a student's assignment using the AI tool and provides a grade.
- A student enrolls in a course, submits an assignment, and receives feedback from the teacher.

## Frontend Usage
